# Welcome to the repository for my App Launcher for Microsoft Office 2010!

## Note that for now I am only getting up-to-speed with GitHub hosting for my applications and will fix bugs and add new features as soon as I get settled in. It may be a while before there is documentation complete on here.

I am not associated with Microsoft in any way, shape, or form. I just thought this application (my App Launcher for Office) would be useful to people. I have checked online for application launchers for Office to see if anyone else had already made one but I didn't find any except for a general-purpose launcher which looked kinda slow to use. Don't get me wrong, it looks nice, it's just something I wouldn't use.

If you want general information about this project, be sure to check the wiki on the right-hand side. It's the button that looks like an open book. Otherwise, keep reading.
